Ghidra Scripts

This repository is a collection of scripts we've written to take the tedium out of reverse engineering. We recommend saving your Ghidra project and committing any outstanding changes to your Ghidra repo *before* running any of these scripts "just in case". 

To run a script, open the Ghidra Script Manager by clicking Window -> Script Manager in the Ghidra UI. Then, add the path to this ghidra-scripts repository to the list of script directories that Ghidra will check as shown below.

After you've added the path to the scripts, you should be able to see the new scripts in the Script Manager. Select the script you'd like to run and click the green play button, or double click the script name.
